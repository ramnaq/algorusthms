# Algorithmust

A variety of algorithms written in Rust. The implementations here are based in
the course/book Algorithms, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (Princeton
University).

I'm learning the language, so I believe this is a good path to absorve Rust's concepts
and reenforce knowledge about algorithms.

## Classes of algorithms

- [Dynammic connectivity](./src/dynammic_connectivity)
  - [Quick find](./src/dynammic_connectivity/quick_find.rs)
  - [Quick union](./src/dynammic_connectivity/quick_union.rs) (not implemented yet)
